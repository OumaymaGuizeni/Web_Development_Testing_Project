        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Black-box testing is a software testing method where the tester evaluates the functionality of the software solely based on the provided specifications or requirements, without delving into its internal workings or implementation details.</p>
    </section>

        <h3>Types Of Black Box Testing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Functional Testing </li>
            <p>Functional Testing is a crucial aspect of Software Testing, where the system undergoes rigorous examination against predefined functional requirements and specifications. This testing methodology ensures that the application adequately meets the specified requirements and performs as expected. It emphasizes the verification of processing outcomes and closely mimics real-world system usage without making any assumptions about the underlying system structure. This article delves into the intricacies of functional testing.</p>
            <li>Regression Testing </li>
            <p>Regression Testing involves scrutinizing both the altered segments of the code and the potentially impacted areas resulting from these modifications. Its primary objective is to ascertain that no fresh errors emerge in the software subsequent to the implementation of changes. The term "regression" signifies the recurrence of an issue, which in the realm of software, denotes the reappearance of a bug.</p>
            <li>Non-Functional Testing </li>
            <p>Non-functional Testing examines the non-functional aspects of the software to ensure they meet the specified requirements. It assesses whether the system's behavior aligns with the prescribed criteria and scrutinizes elements not covered in functional testing.</p>

            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><h6>Independence from Implementation Details:</h6>Testers do not need knowledge of the internal code or system architecture, making Black Box Testing suitable for testing applications developed by external teams or third-party vendors.</td>
                    <td><h6>Limited Test Coverage:</h6>Since testers have no visibility into the internal workings of the software, Black Box Testing may not uncover certain types of defects related to code structure, algorithms, or integration issues.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><h6>Focus on End-User Perspective:</h6>Black Box Testing emphasizes validating the software's functionality from the perspective of end-users, ensuring that it meets their requirements and expectations.</td>
                    <td><h6>Inability to Test Edge Cases:</h6>Black Box Testing may overlook edge cases and boundary conditions that require knowledge of the internal logic to identify, potentially leading to incomplete test coverage.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><h6>Early Detection of Usability Issues:</h6>By focusing solely on the external behavior of the software, Black Box Testing can uncover usability issues and user interface inconsistencies that might otherwise go unnoticed.</td>
                    <td><h6>Difficulty in Reproducing Defects:</h6>When defects are identified through Black Box Testing, it can be challenging to reproduce them consistently without insight into the underlying code, making debugging and resolution more time-consuming.</td>
