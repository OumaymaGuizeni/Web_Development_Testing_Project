        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>White box testing techniques delve into the internal structures of software, including data structures, code design, and functionality, unlike black box testing which primarily focuses on functionality alone. Also referred to as glass box testing or clear box testing, white box testing examines the software's inner workings. It's alternatively termed transparent testing or open box testing.
           White box testing is a software testing approach where the tester scrutinizes the internal structure and mechanisms of a software application. With access to the source code, testers devise test cases to validate the accuracy of the software at a code level.
           Known as structural testing or code-based testing, white box testing evaluates the software's internal logic, flow, and structure. Testers develop test cases to assess code paths and logic flows, ensuring they align with specified requirements.

        <h1>Black Box Testing</h1>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Black-box testing is a software testing method where the tester evaluates the functionality of the software solely based on the provided specifications or requirements, without delving into its internal workings or implementation details.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Types Of Black Box Testing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Functional Testing </li>
            <p>Functional Testing is a crucial aspect of Software Testing, where the system undergoes rigorous examination against predefined functional requirements and specifications. This testing methodology ensures that the application adequately meets the specified requirements and performs as expected. It emphasizes the verification of processing outcomes and closely mimics real-world system usage without making any assumptions about the underlying system structure. This article delves into the intricacies of functional testing.</p>
            <li>Regression Testing </li>
            <p>Regression Testing involves scrutinizing both the altered segments of the code and the potentially impacted areas resulting from these modifications. Its primary objective is to ascertain that no fresh errors emerge in the software subsequent to the implementation of changes. The term "regression" signifies the recurrence of an issue, which in the realm of software, denotes the reappearance of a bug.</p>
            <li>Non-Functional Testing </li>
            <p>Non-functional Testing examines the non-functional aspects of the software to ensure they meet the specified requirements. It assesses whether the system's behavior aligns with the prescribed criteria and scrutinizes elements not covered in functional testing.</p>

    <section id="Grey_Box_Testing">
        <h1>Grey Box Testing</h1>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Gray Box Testing is a software testing approach that amalgamates elements of both Black Box Testing and White Box Testing methodologies.
            In Black Box Testing, testers operate without knowledge of the internal structure of the system, whereas White Box Testing involves full comprehension of the internal workings.
            Gray Box Testing falls between these extremes, offering partial insight into the internal structure, including access to certain data structures and algorithms to formulate test cases.
            The term "Gray Box" reflects the semi-transparent nature of the software being tested, allowing testers to discern some internal components.
            This method is particularly adept at uncovering context-specific errors, especially within web systems.
            Gray Box Testing relies heavily on requirement-based test case generation, leveraging all available conditions prior to executing the test program.
